Why beliving in religions are outdated

Because there are so many religions not all of them can be true at the same time

Religion dont belive in testability. They belive in the power of belif alone.
That means there is no point in arguing to a religous person because there is no test that will convince them.

Beliving in humanity, other people and yourself is better than beliving in a fantasy.
Because humans built countries, cities, roads, schools, ...
Because humans made food, movies, music, ...

Religion just tries to steal ownership of all the greatness people have made


Religion is like an ancient legacy code that used to be relvant and useful but fell out of date when science came and introduced itself.

When Jesus was alive he was just a regular human being just like the rest of us. He wanted to be a great person. He wanted to be a leader. He wanted to make everyones life better. He saw people suffering all around himself.
And he became a great person by telling stories. Fantasies of an ideal way of living an ideal world a picture of reality that sooths the mind. A world and place where there is no conflict over witch gods or religion you should because there is only one True God.
At some point one of his followers wrote the stories down and that became the bible.
There is no question that Jesus made the world at the time a great place.
He gave people a strong sense of unity and peace.
He told people to trust their neighboors and the goodness deep inside them.
What would you have done if you lived 2000 years ago? Before internet and toilets.
How would you have lived your life 2000 years ago? A slave? A master? A theif? A farmer? A soldier? A human?

We dont need the religions itself. We dont need the fictional fantasy stories.
Theese belives are our legacy. What we need is to accept the updated versions.
What we need is the values to guide our lives.
Thy neighboor is not your enemy.
Thy enemy is a living human being too.
Thy will be rewarded for being good to others

Today we can replace the stories with real world stories of actual people who are actually still alive today.
There is plenty vidoes, blogs and news of people telling their story of how they lived their lives and how it went for them.
