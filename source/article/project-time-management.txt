in every project there is a problem with time-management

in every project requirements changes

how likely is the requirements to change
	build a quick iteration
	dont invest in details
	
always work iterativly dont do waterful

even if the customer says that they want exactly that the requirements will change

some developers are exteremly stubborn about following requirements to point

some developers make money out of wasting time and money and fulfilling contracts and are fine with unhappy customers
