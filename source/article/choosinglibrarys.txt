you should always choose popular libraries
	because otherwise you will not find additional addons because no one bother making addons to unpopular libraries

you should never pick libraries that are to restrictive
	because you always need to customize something
	
you should always test several libraries before choosing one
	why would you expect everything to be great just because everyone else says so?
	
same goes for platforms and anything else really
