guid
id

rule always include both id and guid in database tables
remove it in special cases where it sinks the performance

the reason why is because enumeration attacks are a security threat against your publicly exposed api.

you cant add guid afterhand because the id is already in use by many other systems and customers.

future proof yourself by always include guid
