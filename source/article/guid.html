guid
id

rule always include both id and guid in database tables
remove it in special cases where it sinks the performance

the reason why is because enumeration attacks are a security threat against your publicly exposed api.

you cant add guid afterhand because the id is already in use by many other systems and customers.

future proof yourself by always include guid

lose of performance is of small concern compared to the loss of security

what guid should you use?
as long as it protects against enumeration attacks it is fine.

should a guid be used as a shareable link?
no a sharable link generator should keep track of map between outside and internal links.
however the guid-link should work aswell.
the reason why is because a guid-link is typically too long for humans to understand and shows no hint to what it links to.
the sharable links should be generated before it is displayed to the user
