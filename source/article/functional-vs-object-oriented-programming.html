functional programming vs object oriented programming

object oriented
	Java, C++, C#
	JavaScript?

functional programming
	C, JavaScript?

not about the language but rather about design patterns

why do we have design patterns?
clarity
maintailability
efficiency

legacy projects

why object oriented is terrible in some legacy projects
poorly maintained
create new class V1, V2, V3
always new class
codebase is too big and there is too little knowledge about what is in use
the programmer consultance switch often after 2/3 years the knowledge they switch to another job


code should be easy to refactor
moving code is easy with functional programming
copy paste a function to another file
example case?
