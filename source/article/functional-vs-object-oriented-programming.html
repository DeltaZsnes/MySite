functional programming vs object oriented programming

okay as it appears im not fully into functional programming yet so so im still undecided
	i will try to write all new code as functional as possible and w√©ll see if i can make a decision
	functional programming in itself bring too much crap with it.

object oriented
	Java, C++, C#
	JavaScript?

functional programming
	C, JavaScript?

not about the language but rather about design patterns

why do we have design patterns?
efficiency
clarity
testing
maintailability


learning curve
employing developers
senior developers
experience developers
junior developers

everyone understands functions
junior developers have difficulty with type casting inheritance polymorphism

legacy projects

why object oriented is terrible in some legacy projects
poorly maintained
create new class V1, V2, V3
always new class
codebase is too big and there is too little knowledge about what is in use
the programmer consultance switch often after 2/3 years the knowledge they switch to another job


code should be easy to refactor
moving code is easy with functional programming
copy paste a function to another file
example case?

automated testing is much easier with functional programming
examples?

DTO data transfer objects full serializable
	value types
	references types must be serializable
When transferring the data in and outwards

race conditions

shared state

order is important with shared state
Another common problem associated with shared state is that changing the order in which functions are called can cause a cascade of failures because functions which act on shared state are timing dependent:
this makes it diffucult to refactor and reorder

pure functions
that does not mutate the input
returns a copy
