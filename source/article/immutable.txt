the concept of immutability comes from functional programming paradigm

immutability means the objects cannot be modified
however it can be read and copied

thread safe
race conditions?
this leads to easier code
however what order is the code?

over engeering
too much effort?

mutation history
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object
immutability is a compile time language protection ensure there is no mutation history

D has an interesting property called immutable vs const

might have been better to have a new function type called pure functions that the language defines as a function that cannot modify mutate state and
can only return a new object
