poor people are poor because they are stupid.
they have poor ability to understand what is good.
they have poor ability to make good decisions.
they have poor ability to predict and plan for the future.
they fall for every trap there is. drugs, drinking, smoking, gambling, gaming, violence, porn, gold-diggers.
they have poor patience and diligence.
they rely on their feelings more than thinking with their heads.
they dont understand the concept of proof and tests.
they think they deserve more just for existing.
they think working hard should earn more than working smart.
