	You should base your arguments not on feeling but on words You should
	motivate all argumends You should answer all follow up questions You should
	sound trustworthy and belivable Because otherwise you sound like a childish
	bully. Unconvincing and hurtful. You win an argument only if you convince
	others to take your side. You should take a side on a question. Either Yes,
	No or Undecided. Being undecided is just as important as yes or no and
	should obviously be your default stance.

rules for arguing.
i wont motivate if you dont motivate.
i wont answer if you wont answer.


effort
if you are not willing to put in the effort then when should i put in the effort?

if you are not willing to put in the effort of articulating your opinion then why should i listen to you. your opion sounds weak.

if you are not willing to put to defend yourself 

if you are not willing to answer then why should i answer

stop arguing like a bully in kinder garden

your mom jokes

dont expect me to be a mindreader
articulate what you are thinking of
why should i spend effort communicating when you are not
use more words articulate better


argue against unwanted complicated buggy requirements.
say that it is too complex to implement correctly on the first try and will create bugs many bugs and take a long time to fix.
say that it will take several weeks to do. waterfall programming is not good.
say that it would be better to simplify the requirements as a first go and work up from there.
