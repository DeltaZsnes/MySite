	You should base your arguments not on feeling but on words You should
	motivate all argumends You should answer all follow up questions You should
	sound trustworthy and belivable Because otherwise you sound like a childish
	bully. Unconvincing and hurtful. You win an argument only if you convince
	others to take your side. You should take a side on a question. Either Yes,
	No or Undecided. Being undecided is just as important as yes or no and
	should obviously be your default stance.

rules for arguing.
i wont motivate if you dont motivate.
i wont answer if you wont answer.
