Losers smoke
Losers do drugs

Is it okay to be a loser?
No it is not okay. Because:

A loser would say I cant buy food because I am broke.
A loser would say I cant lend you money because I am broke.
A loser would say I cant afford to pay the rent because I am broke.
A loser would say I dont have a girlfriend/boyfriend because no one wants me.
A loser would say I dont make life happen, life happens to me.
A loser would say I hate myself.
