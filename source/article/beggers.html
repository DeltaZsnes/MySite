	i have give money to beggers if you dont contribute to societe you dont
	deserve help from society heart?
</span>

beggers should instead provide
why should i help someone who does not help me?

beggers should instead spend their time aquiring skills and knowledge.

difference between children and adults

children should be given help because they can be taught anything and easily bounce back and rejoin society as productive members

adult beggers should not be given help because they have wasted their entire youth and cant be taught anything. they will never rejoin society as productive members.
	adults who resort to begging after a lifetime of zero accumulated skills and knowledge??? what kinde of behavior am i rewarding?
	you spend your entire youth doing shit and now you cry about that you got punished?
