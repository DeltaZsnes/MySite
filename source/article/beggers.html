	i have give money to beggers if you dont contribute to societe you dont
	deserve help from society heart?
</span>

beggers should instead provide
why should i help someone who does not help me?

beggers should instead spend their time aquiring skills and knowledge.

difference between children and adults

children should be given help because they can be taught anything and easily bounce back and rejoin society as productive members

adult beggers should not be given help because they have wasted their entire youth and cant be taught anything. they will never rejoin society as productive members.
	adults who resort to begging after a lifetime of zero accumulated skills and knowledge??? what kinde of behavior am i rewarding?
	you spend your entire youth doing shit and now you cry about that you got punished?

if you dont add value to yourself or others then you should not be rewarded
this is a rule that applies to both children and adults
	if an adult or child goes to school and learns a skill he or she should be rewarded
	you should not have to pay for basic education
	the idea is that this skill they learn will be useful to others in the future or at the very least the student can become self-susstaining

thus beggers should not be rewarded because they learn nothign useful to neither themself and no skill to be help others with

Why do rules exist. They exist to protect the freedom and safety of the people. At least that is why they should do.
Becuase if you designed the rules in a society where people can end up in slavelike situations where they lost all their freedom and safety then you designed the rules wrong.
