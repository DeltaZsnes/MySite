IntegrationTesting of BackEnd-api

If a FrontEnd makes a call to the BackEnd-Api-Endpoint. Will it return 500 or 200?

Hold your controllers lean and clean no more
functional programming

use integration tests to call each and every public controller endpoint with CI enviroment
make sure they all answer 200 OK.
You only need one CI enviroment in 99.99% of all projects
Dont create a CI enviroment for every seperate customer.

Are Unit-Tests redundant then?
	No of course not. Integration-Tests cant cover all the different data and test cases. They are too time consuming to write and maintain.
	Unit-Tests however are small enough in scope that they can get very specific test coverage of internal functions.
	
Test Coverage
	Flow Coverage
	Range Coverage
