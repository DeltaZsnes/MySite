avoid pluralization in non-refactorable code such as database tables and api interfaces
because people from non-native speaking languages has difficulty understanding pluralization it will cause problems due to language errors and waste developer time
consumers of apis also have difficult with pluralization further wasting developer time.

in refactorable time you can pluralize as much as you want because once a developer spots the error you can fix it immediately

Always enforce sticking to the English language and stop making up words that does not exist. It will just WTF the next developers that on-boards the project. And also all non-english speakers.

For database tables
They are not containers. Singular naming is similar to a class in Object oriented programming
The rows are the instances of that class.
