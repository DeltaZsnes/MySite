dejting & sex
	should start as early as possible
	otherwise you will regeret spending your youth poorly
	only have children after landing a career job
	since after you have children you will not be able to change career.
	preferable you have children when you are as old as possible near 35.
	because you have a strong stable economy in your thirties and you can spend your twenties having fun.
	in your forthies it may become difficult to get a good mate since no one wants to hang around old people.

identity
	history
	strong opions

strong opinins
	write articles about them
	write as if other would read about them
	because you dont want to come of as an idiot
	and other people will challenge your opinion
	which will make your belifs either stronger or weaker
	and that is a good thing becase your belife should be based on reality and not just your inner-reality

	but how much should the punishment be?
