SPA single-page-application
MPA multi-page-application

url routing should make sure that when a client jumps in to a page a request is sent.
robots will pick up on the traffic and index the site

example https://example.com/#news will not send a request to the server and the user will stay on the root page
example https://example.com/news will send a request to the server and robots will pick up on the traffic.
	hmm actually if robots pick up on the traffic either way right?
	
example https://example.com/#!news
	deprecated by google and bing
	google and bing would miss these pages sometimes but not always
	
using hash and bang #! also means that you will always be directed to the root page and cannot be redirected to another page in
	in the future you might decided to split your app from a SPA to a MPA due to reasons (idk ^^)
	which will be made impossible since it also affects the root page and pages dependant on the root page
	
	
so instead use Clean Urls best recommendation any bot and any crawler understands this
	example https://example.com/news?search=economy&from=2018
	in HTML5 use the history pushState function
	
links should be simple to make it easy for crawlers to find them
	<a href="/news?search=economy" /> much better all crawlers support this
	<button onclick="{{document.location='/news?search=economy'}}"></button> weak crawlers will miss this
	interesting fact is if the button modifies the data for example
	<button onclick="{{delete(data.item)}}"></button>
	this implies that the crawler should not press it. or i supposed a crawler should not have access to it in the first place.
	
google and bing robot crawlers are lazy users
	if the site content is loaded only on user interaction the the crawlers arent going to bother with that.
	content that requires several steps of navigation is de-valued / de-ranked because the search engines dont want to inconvencience their users.
	
test using a simple search engine simulator
	https://totheweb.com/learning_center/tools-search-engine-simulator/
	
	http://www.googlebot.com/bot.html

content are ranked highest <--- make sure it is loaded immedietly
titles are important
meta are sort of used
	
relevant - sites that are more releveant in search according to TF-IDF are ranked higher
speed - sites that are slow and unresponsive are de-ranked. not indexed after 5s.
community sites that are linked to from other sites are ranked higher

Conclusion MPA has the best SEO
	Recommended use pure vanilla HTML/CSS for instant page loading.
	Only use javascript for google-user-analytics and advertisement
	Crawlers can disable all javascript and focus on the HTML
	Low-Memory-Usage since there is almost no javascript
	
If you still want use SPA then
	Use <a href> links for all navigation
	The content should be loaded immediatly
	The title should be interesting too
	The meta should update too.
	The memory usage should be low. Some crawlers will blow up their memory and crash.
