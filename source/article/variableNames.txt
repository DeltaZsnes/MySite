variable names should describe its purpose in the context
variable names should describe the purpose in the line where it first occurred

variable be a composition of concepts in the business model

example
	Inventory
	Store
	Auction
	InventoryStore
	InventoryAuction
	AuctionStore

var existing = await _customerService.GetById(1) //gets an existing customer
existing.FirstName = "Sam"; //mutate the existing
existing.LastName = "Samson"; //mutate the existing
await _customerService.Update(existing); //updates the existing with mutations

long variables names are necessary in name spaces where name collision is frequent
example
	AuctionInvoiceBuyersPremiumRepository
	
average variables names are preferred for readability and clarity
example
	CustomerAddress

short variables names are necessary in mathematical formulas to give a good overview of the formula
example
	x1 = -p/2 - Sqrt( (p/2) * (p/2) - q );
	x2 = -p/2 + Sqrt( (p/2) * (p/2) - q );

stick to singular when possible
	because english language has many words with no plural form
	especially when writing code that are difficult to correct later



conclusion there is no silver-bullet and developers who are less skilled will unfortunately not grasp the subtle changes in context
