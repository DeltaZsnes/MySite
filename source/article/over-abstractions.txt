when used well abstractions save you time from repetetive tasks
when used poorly abstractions create time consuming complexity and bugs that are hard to debug and for new developers to grasp

bad examples
	new keywords and concepts
		generator yield async await
		
good example 

junior developers
senior developers

function call
imagine that calling function fx() causes a bug and that you know it is releated to fx()

file
	fx(f1(f2(f3(f4())))) => bug

file...
	f?()
file1
	f1()
file2
	f2()
file3
	f3() => bug
	which of all the previous

each of these
