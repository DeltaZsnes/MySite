Work values

Anyone can add to this but we cannot remove

Business
	If we cannot get money we will lose our jobs
	
Time
	If we cannot deliver our work within the our deadlines then we will lose business

Trust
	If we cannot be trusted we will lose business

Clarity
	If we cannot deliver work that clearly fulfill business goals then our work cannot be trusted

Evidence
	If we cannot prove that our ideas will work according to our values and take us to our goals then we should not waste time and money on doing the work

Testability
	If we cannot test that our work is correct then we cannot know for sure that it is done

Reusability
	If our work is not reusable for the future we will spend unnecessary time and money on redoing the same work over and over again

Performance
	If our work is not perfoming well it will leave opportunity for competitors to overtake us
