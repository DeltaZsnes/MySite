Work values

Anyone can add to this but we cannot remove

Business
	If we cannot get money we will lose our jobs
	We should work in a way so that we fulfill our business goals.
	
Time
	If we cannot deliver our work within the our deadlines then we will lose business
	We should work in a way so that we can reach our deadlines.

Trust
	If we cannot be trusted we will lose business
	We should work in a way that gains us trust
	
Team
	If we are not a team we cannot succeed
	We should work in a way that keeps up the team morale and communication

Clarity
	If we cannot deliver work that other people then we cannot grow our team with new members
	We should work in a way that are understandable by other people

Evidence
	If we cannot prove that our ideas will work according to our values and take us to our goals then we should not waste time and money on doing the work
	We should argue for our thoughs, belifs and ideas with evidence, facts, references and sources instead of feelings.

Testability
	If we cannot test that our work is correct then we cannot know for sure that it is done
	We should test our work and make sure others can test our work and automate the testing work.

Reusability
	If our work is not reusable for the future we will spend unnecessary time and money on redoing the same work over and over again
	
Refactorability
	If we our work cannot be refactored then we cannot improve it.
	We should work in a way so that it can constantly be improved, optimized, tested and understood by the team.

Performance
	If our work is not perfoming well it will leave opportunity for competitors to overtake us
