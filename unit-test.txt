writing unit tests
	should be more unit tests than integration tests
	should be easy to write them
	should be easy to maintain them
	should be clear and easy to read and understand
	
	code should be written testable. however fakers can mitigate most of the dependency problems.

fakers
	fake()
	creates a fake version of the service with all dependencies mocked
	dependencies must have be implementable by the true service and other fakes
	
	
mocks
	mocks an interface with all method calls with default return values.
	the mock does nothing and returns only the language defaults
