TODO change from SPA to MPA site for SEO optimization?
	- Makes sense since this is a blog site and we want crawlers to find it easy
	- Writing HTML code for headers and footers becomes to cumbersome.
		In an MPA page the .html file should include the content and link to the headers and footers and styling.
		This only possible through server side rending.
		The javascript could load the page-template (header and footer) instead with a single directive include

Commands:
 - firebase deploy
