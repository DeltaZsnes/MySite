micro services

opposite to monoliths

a monolith is a project code base that produces one unbreakable 

it needs a clear dependency tree without circular dependencies

Example
Customer should be a base entity //base
CustomerImage depends on Customer //feature
Image should be a base entity //base

Basically the new features should be dependant on previous Base Entity but not the other way around

This poses a problem where the client may have to make multiple network requests to get the Base Entity and all the features
This also poses a problem where the client wants to filter on multiple features at the same time

GraphQL can solve the first response problem by specifying which features it needs in the response.
